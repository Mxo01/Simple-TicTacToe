# Simple Tic Tac Toe simulator against PC

## Introduction
Simply Tic Tac Toe! A very quick and easy version to play against your computer 
(without AI). The operation is like that of a normal Tic Tac Toe and checks if a 
correct number is entered (between 1 and 9) otherwise it prints an "error" message 
asking you to enter a correct number. Once the game is over you are asked if you 
want to start a new one and the board is reset, otherwise the game ends.
## Python installation (Linux only)

To run this code locally you need to install python in your pc 
by following these simple steps:

- First of all check if python is already installed

```bash
  python3 --version
```

- Then check for updates

```bash
  sudo apt update
```
    
- And if so, upgrade

```bash
  sudo apt upgrade
```

- Now you're ready to install python

```bash
  sudo apt install python3
```
